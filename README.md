# Blockchain-and-IoT-Based-supply-chain-system
interacting the RFID sensor with the blockchain network for Supply Chain Tracking System 
blockchain IoT data would increase the supply chain performance.
Our project is interacting the RFID sensor with the blockchain network for Supply Chain Tracking System . We have use smart contract to keep
tracking of products to avoid the flowing of the product problems paper-based, system delay and fake goods. This system is powered by the IOTA Blockchain, so it's fully distributed, immutable and auditable.
We have used IOTA Blockchain and python script for prove-of-consept 



In the Figure show in below describe how the supply chain system will work. The blockchain allows us to unite in a continuous chain all participants. Every product will contain a RFID reader and each RFID has unique Product name and ID. Every participant is able to collect the information on all stages of production. One way that supply chain complexity can be eliminated is by combining blockchain technology with RFID technology is a contactless solution based on a radio frequency field, designed to exchange data between two devices through a simple touch gesture. Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) uses Cancel changeselectromagnetic fields to identify and track tags attached to objects. Combining the two of these with blockchain solutions can lead to flows with increased transparency, more security, and automated administrative operations through the use of smart contracts.
