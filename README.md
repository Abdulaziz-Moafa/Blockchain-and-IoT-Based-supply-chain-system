# Blockchain-and-IoT-Based-supply-chain-system
interacting the RFID sensor with the blockchain network for Supply Chain Tracking System 
blockchain IoT data would increase the supply chain performance.
Our project is interacting the RFID sensor with the blockchain network for Supply Chain Tracking System . We have use smart contract to keep
tracking of products to avoid the flowing of the product problems paper-based, system delay and fake goods. This system is powered by the IOTA Blockchain, so it's fully distributed, immutable and auditable.
We have used IOTA Blockchain and python script for prove-of-consept
